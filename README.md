# cls-using-kosaraju-and-epsilon-constraint
Computer software application that builds integrated crop-livestock systems using Kosaraju's algorithm and epsilon-constraint method

The jupyter notebook 'Appmode-Presentation.ipynb' contains the code on how the application was built as well as the different logic behind the established connections of different crop and livestock component. The application makes use of the dataset 'CLS_data.csv' that contains the different crop nad livestock that users may choose from in building their integrated crop-livestock system.
